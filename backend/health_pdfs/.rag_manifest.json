Moreover, it is unlikely you will ever know everything there is to know about strength training and conditioning. A look at the number of variables involved in strength training and conditioning results in a list of about 50 (e.g., sets, reps, weight, exercise selection, technique, time of day, temperature, training status, etc.). We calculated the number of possible combinations of these variables and came up with a number so large that no one could possibly study and know all the combinations in a lifetime of effort. This means that strength training and conditioning involves such a vast area of knowledge that much of our job will be to reduce the number of things to know to a manageable level by emphasizing those that are the most important. The important things are the \u201cbig ideas\u201d or \u201cbig things.\u201d It is vitally important that you get the \u201cbig things\u201d right.

Fortunately, injuries in strength training and conditioning are rare but constant vigilance and good judgment are always required (6,7,8). Risk management is a tactic that is used to reduce the likelihood of injuries along with the likelihood of legal problems that often accompany injuries.

The knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to design a strength training and conditioning program require a higher level of knowledge than is covered in this manual.

The primary objective of this manual is to prepare you to identify flaws in exercise performance (e.g., posture and technique), fatigue, using too much resistance (or not enough), proper use of the appropriate metabolic energy system, and athlete readiness.

An Overview of Strength Training and Conditioning Basic principles permeate all of strength training and conditioning (refer to the pyramid diagram for an idea of how this manual will attempt to \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d the important basic information you will need to effectively supervise and direct day-to-day training). For example, one of the pillars of strength training and conditioning is the idea of progression. Progression refers to the selection of exercises, loads or resistances, order of exercises, and readiness of the athlete that are just right (not too hard, not too easy) for the status of the athlete and the demands of the activity.

Another basic principle is that of specificity, the body tends to adapt very narrowly to the nature of the exercise performed. Finally, even supervision itself comes in different forms, and it is important to know the circumstances when a particular form of supervision is ideal. Continuing the idea of a broad overview, let us look at the basic principles of training and a few definitions (2,4,9). Training \u2013 Training is the process of preparing an athlete physically, technically, tactically, psychologically, and theoretically rapidly for the highest levels of performance (4). Training involves more than simple growth and maturation and, of course, the highest levels of performance will be relative to the current status and genetic gifts of the athlete. Volume \u2013 Volume is the amount of work performed. Sets and repetitions of an exercise combine to make volume (1). If you are a runner, volume is the distance you covered. If you are strength training, volume is the product of sets x repetitions of an exercise.", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk": 5}, "29013916531000": {"text": "Basics of Strength and Conditioning 9 Intensity \u2013 Intensity is the difficulty of the work. Intensity is the amount of weight or resistance used in a particular exercise (1). If you are a runner, intensity is running speed. If you are strength training, intensity is the resistance or weight lifted. Volume-Load \u2013 Volume-load is the combination of volume and intensity. Volume-load is usually calculated as sets x repetitions x weight, or resistance used (1). Frequency \u2013 Frequency is simply the number of training sessions expressed per day, per week, per month, and so forth (1). Principles of Training 1. Principle of Individuality Every individual is unique and will respond differently to the same training stimulus. Some of these differences can be influenced by many characteristics; biological age, training age, gender, body size and shape, past injuries and many more. For example, a college athlete makes a copy of his exact training program and gives it to his little brother who is a freshman in high school. The younger brother does not miss a workout, and at the end of the program, he is disappointed in the results. Though many variables could play a role in the results, the primary", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 0}, "29013916531001": {"text": "hman in high school. The younger brother does not miss a workout, and at the end of the program, he is disappointed in the results. Though many variables could play a role in the results, the primary factor is most likely the large range in biological and training age. 2. Principle of Speci\ue01fcity Training adaptations for an individual will occur specifically to the muscle groups trained, the intensity of the exercise, the metabolic demands of the exercise, and/or specific movements and activities. In an attempt to perfect a specific skill or activity, you must perform that skill or activity with proper body mechanics to have correct technique. For example, a 100-m sprinter is not going to train for an event by running three miles at a low intensity for an extended period. The sprinter will train by sprinting short distances at very high intensities. 3. Principle of Overload In order for an individual to achieve a certain training adaptation, the body must be stressed by working against a stimulus or load that is greater than that to which it is accustomed. Overload, ensures improvement by challenging changes in resistance, terrain, movement complexity, and many others. For example,", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 1}, "29013916531002": {"text": "a stimulus or load that is greater than that to which it is accustomed. Overload, ensures improvement by challenging changes in resistance, terrain, movement complexity, and many others. For example, if an athlete is trying to increase force production to jump higher, the athlete must train to increase overall strength and power. When training with the hang clean at three sets of five repetitions, the athlete should load the bar with a weight that will allow them to use great technique at a desired velocity. If the bar is loaded with a weight that prevents them from reaching their desired velocity, then the specific training adaptation will not be obtained. 4. Principle of Progression In order to achieve the desired training adaptations for a certain activity or skill consistently, the training stimulus must gradually and constantly increase. This implies that there is an optimal level and time frame for the overload to occur. If overload increases too quickly, poor technique, improper muscle firing patterns, and injury may result. If overload progresses too slowly, improvements will be minimal or non-existent. Rest and recovery must also be included in the progression, as training", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 2}, "29013916531003": {"text": "muscle firing patterns, and injury may result. If overload progresses too slowly, improvements will be minimal or non-existent. Rest and recovery must also be included in the progression, as training hard all the time could result in chronic fatigue, a decrease in performance and eventually injury. For example, at the beginning of the training program, an athlete may be able to perform three sets of ten repetitions at 135 lb. At first, this may be a tough task for the athlete to accomplish, but as the athlete consistently trains, the task will become easier and the load must be increased. The next week the load increases to 145 lb until all ten reps can be completed with correct technique. The athlete must progressively overload the muscles to increase performance. 5. Principle of Diminishing Returns Performance gains are related to the level of training (training age) of each individual. Athletes that have never participated in a training program before can see huge initial performance gains in their program. On the other hand, athletes that have been lifting for several years will see smaller gains over longer periods of time. As an athlete nears their genetic potential, the gai", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 3}, "29013916531004": {"text": "ce gains in their program. On the other hand, athletes that have been lifting for several years will see smaller gains over longer periods of time. As an athlete nears their genetic potential, the gains in performance will be much harder to obtain. The key is to continue to show progress in the areas in which they have weaknesses. For example, when an athlete first starts a training program as a freshman in college the athlete\u2019s vertical jump may improve from 22 in. to 30 in. in the first year. As the athlete continues to train through the next three years, their vertical jump performance may increase from 30 in. to 38. Achieving the eight-inch improvement in the final three years is much more significant and difficult than the eight inches in the first year. 6. Principle of Reversibility When a training stimulus is taken away from an athlete for an extended period of time, they will not be able to maintain a certain level of performance. Over time, the gains that were achieved will return to the original level. For example, when an athlete takes the summer off from training they can expect to become detrained.

Moreover, training principles simply help reduce the universe of ideas of which you need to consider. Another aspect of strength training and conditioning is the utilization of proper energy systems. Overview of Energy Systems The following section will review the energy systems associated with the production and use of energy within the body. The most efficient and effective strength training and conditioning programs are designed with an understanding of the transfer of energy between all of the biological energy systems. It is beyond the scope of this manual to define the specific chemical reactions and processes within the body that generate and replenish energy.

Through various reactions within the body, an intermediate molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is generated, which allows for the transfer of energy from various reactions. This molecule is classified as a high-energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in its chemical bonds. Through the breakdown of ATP, the body is able to provide the necessary energy to perform activities (without an adequate supply of ATP muscular activity and muscular growth would not be possible). Since ATP is stored in such limited quantities within muscle cells, three main energy systems exist in muscle cells to replenish ATP and provide the constant energy needed for muscle action (1). All of the energy systems are active all of the time; however, the contribution of one energy system may be dominant based on the intensity and duration of a specific activity.

This energy system is considered anaerobic because it does not require the presence of oxygen to metabolize energy.

Since the phosphagen system cannot store large amounts of energy, it is the dominant energy system for high-intensity activities that last no longer than 20 \u2013 30 s (1). If an activity lasts longer than 20 \u2013 30 s, energy supply shifts to the glycolytic energy system. Glycolytic System The glycolytic system has a much higher capacity for storing energy. This energy system, which is often broken into fast and slow glycolysis, is also considered anaerobic because it breaks down carbohydrates to produce ATP. Since it has a higher capacity for storing energy, this system is dominant during activities that last between 30 s and 2 \u2013 3 min (1).

The body shifts between the various energy systems on a moment-to-moment basis in order to provide the energy necessary for movement and restoration. The energy systems respond to training specifically, as described by the principle of specificity. Since all energy systems are active all of the time, it is important to understand and differentiate when each system is dominant for each specific activity in order to design efficient and productive training programs that meet the needs of the activity.

Program design is an overview perspective on what strength training and conditioning coaches should do to prepare athletes for their preparatory and competitive seasons. Properly designed strength training and conditioning programs are vital to any athletic preparation. Strength training and conditioning programs can improve athletic performance, decrease the likelihood of injuries, and allow for the development of sound weightlifting and basic resistance training techniques (18,22,23,30,35). Development of these attributes allows athletes to gain a strong foundation of fundamental strength training and conditioning practices, and be adequately prepared for advanced strength training and conditioning programs (e.g., collegiate training programs). How Do We Organize Training? Training theory uses models of training application that have evolved over 60 years. A model is a simplification or simulation of a real-world complex process (8,9,10).

A model is a simplification or simulation of a real-world complex process (8,9,10). One should know that a model is never exactly like the real-world situation, but attempts to simulate the most important aspects that need attention while ignoring those factors that are considered unimportant. The term used to describe the special planning that occurs with athletic training is \u201cperiodization.\u201d Periodization is composed of two major concepts that occur simultaneously. Training is divided into \u201cperiods,\u201d and these periods are cyclic in that various aspects of training are repeated and form a system (31). Training Design Terminology As with every other area covered in this manual, we have had to cover new terms that are a part of the knowledge area, and sometimes the culture of a particular facet of strength training and conditioning. The following list is a summary of some important terms that will be needed to carry on further in the study of training design.

The SAID principle states that an athlete\u2019s body will adapt to exactly what is demanded of it\u2014no more and no less. This principle says that you must give the athlete\u2019s body an unambiguous message of what you want it to become by providing training stressors that mimic all, or parts, of the target physical capacities or skills. The SAID principle constrains strength training and conditioning coaches in their program designs to achieve specific adaptations based on the demands put on the system. Annual Plan Training theory goes to considerable lengths to describe the time dimension in designing training tasks. An annual plan is the calendar-based approach used to place the various demands of training within a calendar year. Usually, the annual plan begins immediately following the last competition of the previous season, and ends after the last competition of the succeeding season.

Macrocycle The terms \u201cmacrocycle\u201d and \u201cannual plan\u201d have occasionally been used synonymously (17). The macrocycle, for our purposes, is the linking of the general physical preparation phase, the specific preparation phase, the pre-competitive phase, the competitive phase, and the peak phase. As such, often it is convenient to link together all of the work leading to a single championship contest. If there is more than one major competition per year, then the year may need more than one macrocycle, typically one for each major season. For example, spring ball and fall ball in football, and the indoor and outdoor seasons of track and field will need to be considered two macrocycles per annual plan (or year). Mesocycle A mesocycle is an intermediate duration of time planning that usually lasts from weeks to a few months. The mesocycle is perhaps the first functional unit for training planning where specific training goals may be assigned and achieved during a particular mesocycle. For example, a pre-competitive mesocycle for basketball might be a period of a month or so where the dominant form of training is scrimmaging.

Or, a mesocycle may be assigned to a shot putter in the early season to use strength training and conditioning to enhance his/her maximal strength. Microcycle A microcycle is a smaller time division that lasts from one to a few weeks. The microcycle is the smallest unit of planning in which we can expect to see the beginnings of relatively stable adaptations. Typically, it takes about a week of consistent training demands for the body to be pushed or forced to adapt, and thus change its chemistry, biomechanics, and/or skills to adapt to the training demands. Training Lesson A training lesson is a single bout of training where the athlete begins a session with a warm-up, practices some aspect of the sport or strength training and conditioning, and then ends the session with a cool-down.

Program In the strength training and conditioning world, a program is the actual exercises, sets, repetitions, resistances, inter-set rest periods, inter-lesson rest periods, and so forth. An example program is provided at the end of this chapter. Basis of Program Design Decisions You will find nearly all program design literature to be triphasic (3 phases), or have three periods/stages. For example, nearly all program designs are based on a simple yet profound idea proffered by Hans Selye called the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) (49,50).", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk": 5}, "29013916531600": {"text": "Basics of Strength and Conditioning 15 The GAS consists of three phases: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion (16,17). The athlete begins with a level of being called \u201chomeostasis\u201d (7). The alarm phase occurs when the athlete is presented with a large enough stressor to evoke fatigue (16,17). Stress is defined as anything that causes an organism, or in this case an athlete, to react (49,50). The alarm stage is distinguished by markers of fatigue, reduced performance abilities, and decreased physical capacities. The resistance phase occurs when the body temporarily adapts to the applied stressor and is able to cope physically with the demands. The resistance phase indicates that the athlete has achieved a level of adaptation that is actually greater or better than his/her previous homeostatic level. Finally, if the stressor is too great to continue to resist, the stimulation increases, or the athlete is not allowed to rest, then the body slips into the exhaustion phase. During the exhaustion phase, symptoms of the alarm phase return but the magnitude is greater and the fatigue much more profound.

In Figure 2-1, athlete preparedness is represented by a curved line at the top of the graphic. Homeostasis is the horizontal line labeled at the right. Note that the line that represents athletic preparedness shows that the athlete fatigues, recovers, and then supercompensates (enters the resistance stage). If nothing else is done, the athlete returns to homeostasis via involution, or descends into overtraining and exhaustion due to the return of fatigue and the inability of the athlete to continue to compensate for the applied stressors.

Rules for Exercise Selection and Prescription The field of strength training and conditioning is driven by research-based information that allows for the proper utilization of sets, repetitions, volume, and rest periods to elicit desired physiological adaptations. The information surrounding these topics has been a topic of discussion for many years. Professional organizations have guidelines and recommendations associated with these variables that allow strength training and conditioning coaches to target specific adaptations to the physiological system (based on the guidelines provided) (3,4,5,24,26).

Direct access to these guidelines and recommendations should be available to strength training and conditioning coaches at any facility. Access to this information will not only decrease the chance of injuries (due to improper programming) but also provide correct prescription to target physiological variables progressively during the course of a training macrocycle.

Warm-Up and Stretching A warm-up is designed to prepare an athlete for training or competition, and can improve subsequent performance and lessen the risk of injuries. A warm-up should be incorporated in every program design. A warm-up period is important before any athletic performance or physical activity, the goal being to prepare the athlete mentally and physically for exercise or competition. A well-designed warm-up should increase muscle temperature, circulation, and provide an opportunity for skill rehearsal (1,28,37,57). Moreover, one of the aspects of a warm-up is simply to \u201cstir\u201d cellular content so the sarcoplasm becomes liquefied (43,45,47,58). These warm-up effects can have the following positive impacts on performance: \u2022 Faster muscle contraction and relaxation of both agonist and antagonist muscles (33) Figure 2-1.

Components of a Warm-Up A total warm-up program includes the following two components (17,28,31,37): A general warm-up period may consist of 5 \u2013 10 min of slow activity, such as jogging or skipping. Alternatively, low-intensity sport-specific actions, such as dribbling a soccer ball, can be productive during this time. This provides a very sport-specific general warm-up that aids in skill development and raises body temperature.

A specific warm-up period incorporates movements similar to the movements of the athlete\u2019s sport. It involves 8 \u2013 12 min of dynamic stretching that focuses on movements that work through the range of motion required for the sport, such as the walking knee lift.

Repetition Ranges for Specific Training Outcomes sprint drills, bounding activities, or jumping, follow the dynamic stretching. The more power necessary for the sport or activity, the more important the warm-up becomes. Including high-intensity dynamic exercises can facilitate subsequent performance. This phase should also include rehearsal of the skills to be performed. A warm-up should progress gradually and provide sufficient intensity to increase muscle and core temperatures without causing fatigue or reducing energy stores. It is likely that there are optimal levels of warm-ups related to the specific sport, the athlete, and the environment, so no one warm-up routine is best for every athlete, or sport. Stretching During Warm-Up There are four main types of stretching: static, ballistic, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). Static stretching has long been used in a warm-up, with the aim of enhancing performance. However, recent reviews of the literature surrounding the role of static stretching question this practice (51,52). There is little, if any, evidence that stretching pre- or post-participation", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 18, "chunk": 0}, "29013916531801": {"text": "mance. However, recent reviews of the literature surrounding the role of static stretching question this practice (51,52). There is little, if any, evidence that stretching pre- or post-participation prevents injury or subsequent muscle soreness (32,34,46,48,51,52). Although static stretching before activity may increase performance in sports that require an increased range of motion, such as gymnastics, stretching activities may or may not influence subsequent strength, power, running speed, reaction time, and strength endurance performance, and often depends on what intermittent activity was used between the stretching and the strength activity (11,12,13,19,20,36,40,41,44,48,54,55,56). In these cases it is important that the strength training and conditioning professional performs a benefit\u2013risk analysis when choosing whether or not to include static stretching in a warm-up (38). Dynamic stretching, which is functionally based and sues sport- specific movements to prepare for activity, does not seem to elicit the performance reduction effects of static and PNF stretching, but has been shown to improve subsequent running performance (27,60,61).

Given these findings, the use of static, PNF, and ballistic stretching in a warm-up needs to be questioned. Based on current evidence, dynamic stretching is the preferred option for stretching during a warm-up. The degree of stretching required in a warm-up depends on the type of sport. Sports that require increased flexibility, such as gymnastics or diving, require a greater degree of stretching (52). Additionally, those sports with high demands for a stretch- shortening cycle of high-intensity, as in sprinting and American football, are likely to require more stretching than those with low or medium stretch-shortening cycle activity, as in jogging or cycling (59). Strength training and conditioning professionals should look at the specific range of motion and stretch-shortening cycle requirements of the sport or activity and use this information to design an appropriate warm-up routine.

Correct execution of exercises with the addition of competent spotting is a pillar of resistance training\u2019s contribution to injury prevention. Technique Fundamentals There are several commonalities amongst resistance training exercise techniques. Most free weight and machine exercises involve some sort of handgrip on a bar, dumbbell, or handle, and all exercises proceed from an optimal body or limb position, movement range and speed, and method of breathing. Additionally, some exercises may also warrant the use of a weight belt and certain procedures for lifting a bar off the floor (2). Handgrips Resistance training involves two main types of handgrips: (a) the pronated grip, with palms down and knuckles up as you face the bar, also called the overhand grip; and (b) the supinated grip, with palms up and knuckles down as you face the bar, also called the underhand grip (2). A neutral grip is the position where the palms face each other\u2014as in a handshake. Neutral grips often apply to dumbbells and some specially designed angled bars.

A neutral grip is the position where the palms face each other\u2014as in a handshake. Neutral grips often apply to dumbbells and some specially designed angled bars. Two less common grips are the alternated grip, in which one hand is in a pronated grip and the other is in a supinated grip, and the hook grip, which is similar to the pronated grip except that the thumb is positioned under the index and middle fingers (2). The hook grip is typically used for performing exercises that require a stronger grasp on the bar due to the higher resistance (e.g., snatch). Note that the thumb is wrapped around the bar in all of the grips shown; this position is called a closed grip. When the thumb does not wrap around the bar, the grip is open, or considered a false grip. Establishing the proper grip in an exercise involves placing the hands at the correct distance from each other (referred to as the grip width) (2). Grip Width The three main handgrip widths are common, wide, and narrow. For most exercises, the hands are placed at approximately shoulder-width (2).

Hand positioning for all exercises should result in a balanced, even bar (Figure 3-2). Stable Body and Limb Positioning Whether an exercise requires lifting a barbell or dumbbell from the floor, or pushing and pulling while on a machine, establishing a stable position is critical. A stable position enables the athlete to maintain proper body alignment during an exercise, which in turn places the appropriate stress on the target muscles. Exercises performed while standing typically require that foot position be slightly wider than hip-width with the heels and balls of the feet in contact with the floor. Establishing a stable position in, or on, machines sometimes requires adjusting the seat or movable resistance arm, fastening belts snugly, or correctly placing movable pads. Seated, or supine, exercises performed on a bench require a specific posture. The athlete should position the body to achieve a five-point body contact position: 1. Head in neutral position on bench or back pad 2. Shoulders and upper back set evenly on bench or back pad 3. Buttocks on bench or seat 4. Right foot flat on floor 5.

Align the target joint, and thus its muscle group(s) involved in the exercise, with the axis of the machine. Proper machine placement may require seat, roller pad, thigh pad, back pad, or chest pad adjustment. Range of Motion and Speed Nearly all exercises use the full range of motion of a joint or machine. Advanced training approaches (not covered here) sometimes use less than the full range of motion. When the goal is power or explosive exercise performance, the effort should accelerate the resistance to a maximal, controllable speed. Some machines do not permit rapid movements.

Instruct athletes to exhale through the sticking point and to inhale during the less stressful phase of the repetition. Breath holding (called the Valsalva maneuver) is appropriate in some exercise situations. The Valsalva maneuver is reserved for advanced athletes, and can be helpful for maintaining proper vertebral alignment and support (1,2). The Valsalva maneuver involves expiring against a closed glottis, which, when combined with contracting the abdomen and rib muscles, creates more rigidity in the abdominal area to help stabilize the spine (1,2). The resulting increase in intra-abdominal pressure has potentially detrimental side effects, such as dizziness, disorientation, excessively high blood pressure, and blackouts. Breath holding should be transient, about 1 \u2013 2 s, and allow the athlete to stabilize the spine during the high exertion range of motion and then breathe again.

Lifting a Bar from the Floor Proper position of the feet and back enables the leg muscles to provide the major contribution for lifting from the floor. It is important to keep the bar close to the body and the back flat during the upward movement. Encourage the athlete to bend at the knees more than at the hips in order to lift the resistance from the floor. Spotting A spotter is someone who assists in the execution of an exercise to help protect the athlete from injury. Spotting resistance exercises is a skill. As a skill, spotting requires instruction and practice. A spotter may also serve to motivate the athlete and help in partner- assisted repetitions. However, the spotter\u2019s primary responsibility is the safety of the athlete. Types of Exercises that Require Spotting Free weight exercises performed over the head (e.g., barbell shoulder press), with the bar on the back (e.g., back squat), with the bar racked anteriorly on the front of the shoulders or on the clavicles (e.g., front squat), and over the face (e.g., bench p", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 30, "chunk": 1}, "29013916533002": {"text": "ell shoulder press), with the bar on the back (e.g., back squat), with the bar racked anteriorly on the front of the shoulders or on the clavicles (e.g., front squat), and over the face (e.g., bench press, lying triceps extension) are challenging for the athlete. When lifting heavy resistances, the role of the spotter increases due to the potential inability of the athlete to lift the weight to a safe position. Some specific exercises or lifts may require more than one spotter. For example, weights lifted to the side, or too heavy resistances for a single spotter to handle, may require the aid of other spotters to watch the weight(s) while another spotter assists the athlete. Vigilance is required whenever the bar is over the head, over the face, or otherwise unstable. Spotting dumbbell exercises typically requires more skill than spotting barbell exercises because there are two pieces of equipment to control. Contraindications for spotting include power exercises at high speeds.

Clear all objects that might cause tripping from the lifting area. One of the most common causes of injury in a weight training area is tripping over a weight plate on the floor. Nonparticipating athletes should stay clear of the lifting area and avoid distracting the lifter\u2019s attention by standing or moving in front of the athlete. Spotters must be strong enough and tall enough to catch unstable weights and match the height of the athlete. Spotting Over-the-Face Exercises The spotter should grasp the bar with an alternated grip, usually narrower than the athlete\u2019s grip when spotting an over-the-face exercise. The spotter should use an alternated grip to pick up the bar and return it to the floor, or rack, and a supinated grip to spot the bar during the lift. The grips described help ensure that the bar does not roll out of the spotter\u2019s hands and onto the athlete\u2019s face or neck. For dumbbell exercises, the spotter should spot as close to the dumbbells as possible.", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 30, "chunk": 3}, "29013916533004": {"text": "described help ensure that the bar does not roll out of the spotter\u2019s hands and onto the athlete\u2019s face or neck. For dumbbell exercises, the spotter should spot as close to the dumbbells as possible. In some dumbbell exercises, it is more practical to spot the arms of the athlete rather than the dumbbells. Spotting at the forearms near the wrists provides a safer technique in these situations. Note that for some exercises (e.g., dumbbell pullover and overhead dumbbell triceps extension) it is necessary to spot with hands directly on the dumbbells. Spotting Considerations for Power Exercises Spotting recommendations change for power exercises. Instead of spotting power exercises, the coach should teach the athlete how to get away from a bar that is out of control or unstable. Spotting these types of exercises is too dangerous to both the spotter and athlete. When the bar is in front of the athlete, the athlete should miss the lift by pushing the bar away or simply dropping it. If the bar becomes unstable behind the head, the athlete should release the bar and jump forward. For these reasons, a clear area and platform are necessary to avoid injury to the athlete and others.

For these reasons, a clear area and platform are necessary to avoid injury to the athlete and others. Number of Spotters The number of spotters is determined directly by the specific exercise and the load. The experience and ability of the athlete and spotters, strength of the spotters, and mutual experience also helps determine the number of spotters. Obviously, with heavier loads, the likelihood of injuries increases. Once the load exceeds a single spotter\u2019s ability to effectively protect the athlete (and him- or herself), incorporate another spotter. Communication between Athlete and Spotter Communication is a shared responsibility. Before beginning a set, the spotter(s) and athlete should establish and communicate how initial bar movements will occur, the intended number of repetitions, and signals for moving the bar into position. If the spotters do not have this information, they may take control of the bar improperly, too soon, or too late, and consequently disrupt the exercise or injure the athlete or themselves.", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 30, "chunk": 5}, "29013916533100": {"text": "Basics of Strength and Conditioning30 Amount and Timing of Spotting Assistance Sometimes less is more. In addition to protecting the athlete from a fall or dropped weight, a spotter should know how much to assist the athlete when the situation demands only marginal assistance. At the first indication that a repetition is failing, the athlete should quickly ask or signal the spotter (sometimes with just a grunt or sound) for help, and the spotter needs to provide the amount of assistance needed for safe completion. If the athlete cannot contribute anything to the completion of the repetition, the athlete should immediately tell the spotter to \u201ctake it\u201d or use a similar phrase. The spotter should take the bar from the athlete quickly and smoothly. Spotting Techniques Note that the exercises in this section serve as a model for spotting technique.

As described previously, when designing and implementing strength and conditioning programs, strength training and conditioning coaches need to have an objective for the training session and training cycle. This will ensure that programs target the physiological characteristics they are designed to target. The special methods of training reviewed in this chapter will allow for a greater understanding of different methods that can be implemented within strength training and conditioning programs to illicit improvements in performance through speed and agility training.

A simple jumping exercise can be classified as a plyometric exercise if it involves an eccentric muscle action (lengthening of the muscle tissue), amortization phase (phase between eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and a concentric muscle action (shortening of the muscle tissue). These three components allow athletes to utilize the musculoskeletal system to produce greater force following the eccentric muscle action. For example, a countermovement jump involves a quick lowering of the body to produce eccentric tension in the relevant musculature which is then followed by a transition from down to up, the amortization phase, and then the athlete develops concentric or shortening tension in the relevant muscles as he/she performs the \u201cup\u201d phase of the jump.

It is imperative that the musculoskeletal system is given time to adapt to the demands of a plyometric training program (6,7,8). Plyometric exercise sessions should begin with a general warm-up, dynamic stretching, and specific warm-up movements. The specific warm-up for plyometric training should consist of low-intensity, dynamic movements. During the warm-up, the athlete gradually progresses to actual plyometric or rebound types of exercises. Plyometric exercise is not inherently dangerous; however, developing an adequate base of strength and power should be seen as a prerequisite for serious plyometric training. Low- intensity plyometrics, such as running, leaping, hopping, and so forth, can be used with novice athletes.

Landing surfaces, proper footwear, number of repetitions, base strength, and speed of execution all interact in plyometric training and affect the intensity, volume, and/or injury potential of the exercise. Plyometrics are merely a part of an overall strength training and conditioning program that includes strength, speed, agility, aerobic and anaerobic training, flexibility training, and proper nutrition. Plyometrics have a purpose, which is usually described as power and speed training, but plyometrics are not a panacea (9,13,21,24,28). Plyometrics Virtually all of the things required during athletic events involve one\u2019s ability to exert force in a rapid manner. This ability to exert force can be in the form of jumping, hopping, and changes of direction (1). Improving one\u2019s ability to exert force in a rapid manner can have a positive influence on sports performance.

The Stretch-Shortening Cycle A common mistake is to confuse plyometrics (the exercise the athlete performs) with the stretch-shortening cycle (the mechanism underlying the tissue response).

Figure 5-1 shows the three phases of the stretch-shortening cycle along with the underlying physiology that accompanies each phase. Deceleration and Jump Training for Novice Athletes Conventional resistance training should be used prior to plyometrics in order to promote general strength gains and connective tissue development (10,11). One of the other methods used to promote general strength and connective tissue development is deceleration/jump training. This type of training does not involve high levels of orthopedic demands, and thus reduces the likelihood of injury. These exercises involve an emphasis on landing mechanics. Putting a large emphasis on landing mechanics also allows for the development of eccentric strength in a dynamic environment. The key to this type of training is to promote dynamic eccentric strength and the landing mechanics of each exercise. Coaches can use jumps in place (drills that involve jumping and landing in the same spot), multiple hops, and jumps that cover distance.

For all of these types of jumps, emphasis should be on the landing portion of the jump, and one\u2019s ability to decelerate and avoid reaching the extreme range of motion limit of the joints. One of the major distinctions between plyometric training and traditional strength training and conditioning is that plyometric training targets the nervous system more than the muscular system. The nervous system is trained to respond rapidly and without hesitation. Factors that influence the intensity of plyometric exercises are shown in Figure 5-2. Speed and Agility Two methods of training that have been utilized for many years are speed and agility training. Speed and agility training usually involves moving at high rates of speed. Speed training involves running and other rapid movements (4,15,18,22,29). There are different types of speed: Reactive Speed: The ability to react to a stimulus in the shortest possible time (reactive speed involves both simple and choice reactions) Active Speed: The ability to move quickly and precisely during short duration activities of less than 6 s (active spee", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 62, "chunk": 1}, "29013916536202": {"text": "shortest possible time (reactive speed involves both simple and choice reactions) Active Speed: The ability to move quickly and precisely during short duration activities of less than 6 s (active speed involves noncyclic movements) Frequency Speed: The ability to run, walk, row, climb, swim, and so forth involving cyclic movement activities Complex Speed: The ability to holistically combine reactivity, perception, spatial relationships, and so forth to produce movements that are coordinated and goal directed, and involves primarily noncyclic activities (29) Agility training combines moving at high speeds with rapid changes of direction. Agility training is commonly used to mimic competitive situations and improve the ability of athletes to simulate the movement and perceptual demands of the sport. This method of training usually involves movement patterns that target multiple changes of direction over the course of an activity. In many cases, speed training and agility training are performed together (i.e., within the same training session or within the same training cycle).

Utilizing speed and agility training can improve the transfer of performance from the accumulation effect of the training sessions to competitive situations (4,5). Linear Speed One of the key elements of a conditioning program is ensuring the athletes move as efficiently and effectively as possible. In relation to speed, it is essential that an effective sprinting technique be stressed from day one. The length of each step (step length, SL) and the number of steps taken over a specific distance (step frequency, SF) determine the speed or velocity of an athlete (velocity = SL x SF) (16). In most sports, the key factor in linear speed is not the top speed achieved, but the ability to accelerate (i.e., the first 10 yards) (25,30,31). Acceleration refers to the rate of change in velocity over time.

As force can only be applied while the foot is in contact with the ground, the more time the foot is on the ground, the greater amount of force can be produced through each step. As the athlete reaches maximum velocity (by 30 \u2013 40 yards), step length will likely increase while step frequency will likely decrease (16). In sports, athletes may be required to accelerate from a static position or from a rolling start where they may already be walking or jogging prior to the sprint. Therefore, both of these forms of acceleration should be addressed in speed and agility training. Agility The term \u201cagility\u201d encompasses a wide range of movements and abilities that athletes are required to perform throughout competition. Agility movements can be defined as rapid, whole- body movements that require single or multiple changes in velocity (i.e., acceleration or deceleration) or direction (i.e., vertical, lateral, or horizontal) in response to an external stimulus (e.g., opponent movements, location of the ball, etc.) (14,26,27).

From this definition, it is clear that reactive decision-making, technique, and physical capabilities all contribute to the success of an agility performance; therefore, agility training programs should include all three of these aspects. While some training approaches are beneficial for optimal gains in agility performance (i.e., interval training), others such as aerobic conditioning focus on opposing energy systems (oxidative versus phosphagen) and muscle fibers (slow twitch versus fast twitch) than that required for rapid and explosive movements in agility. Coaches should limit high-mileage running (e.g., distance running) for athletes during the base lifting phase and for athletes that are not required to perform aerobically during competition. By including distance running in anaerobic agility programs, strength gains may be compromised, training intensity may decrease due to athletes pacing themselves (as a result of limited rest during training sessions), and the potential for overuse injuries will likely increase.

Above all, agility training should be performed in an environment and manner that simulates the conditions and demands of the competition as closely as possible. If the athletes are regularly required to perform lateral cuts followed by short bursts of speed in games or matches, then these movement sequences should be replicated in training. In contrast, if athletes are not required to transition from backpedaling to forward sprinting in their sport, then there is no need to include these tasks as regular elements in the training program. Interval Training Interval training is a series of high-intensity, short duration exercises or drills followed by a period of rest. The ratio of this work-to-rest interval is typically 1-to-10 (which is applicable to most power-based sports). This means if the drill lasts 5 s, the athlete should then be given 50 s to recover before performing another drill.

Rather than having all athletes in a single group run at the same time, rest cycles can be easily built into drills by dividing the athletes into two smaller groups.

It is important to make sure that the resting group is still given their full 50 s of rest before performing the drill again (i.e., the resting group will not be starting the drill immediately following the previous group\u2019s completion). The intensity within each drill can be increased to challenge the performance of the athletes. Having athletes race each other is an easy way to increase the intensity of the drill. A common training error of coaches is making the rest interval too short. For example, when athletes are required to jog or run to the next station with no recovery between drills, athletes tend to pace themselves and decrease the intensity so they are able to complete the workout.

Components of Agility There are many factors that contribute to the overall success of a given agility performance. Fortunately, these qualities can be grouped into four main categories: 1) perceptual/decision- making factors; 2) technical factors; 3) physical factors; and 4) anthropometric factors (body shape and size) (Figure 5-3) (17). The following section will briefly describe the importance of each component to agility performance and the trainability of each. Perceptual Decision-Making Factors The perceptual/decision-making component relies on the ability of the athlete to recognize specific cues from the situation, and react in a timely and appropriate manner. Decision-making is a difficult quality to train in an athlete due to constantly varying scenarios and circumstances in sports.

Technical Factors The development of proper technique is crucial to the success of many team and individual sports. The same is true for the efficient and effective execution of agility drills. Beginning at the developmental level, proper technique in all aspects of the sport should be emphasized. As athletes progress to more advanced competition and skill levels of the sport, the techniques that were learned early will begin to become autonomous, allowing athletes to shift their focus to other aspects of the sport.

While the techniques employed during the approach and take-off phases of a jump are important for attaining maximal height, distances, positioning on the field/court, the techniques used when landing are even more important when trying to minimize the risk of injury. Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common among athletes, particularly when landing from a jump. Females sustain noncontact ACL injuries 2 \u2013 8 times more often than males (12,23). This is often attributed to a wider pelvis and increased Q-angle (Figure 5-4) associated with females when compared to males. Increased leg stiffness upon landing coupled with decreased strength in the thigh musculature when compared to males is also likely to contribute to the higher incidence of noncontact ACL injuries in female athletes (23).

Joint stiffness upon landing (i.e., limited flexion at the hips, knees, and ankles upon impact) will require the large ground reaction forces to be absorbed by only one or two joints (primarily the knee). Landing on the balls of the feet and immediately flexing the hips, knees, and ankles upon impact will help dissipate the large ground reaction forces over several joints and accompanying muscles, and will likely result in decreased strain on the knees. It is also important to emphasize proper lower body alignment upon landing. The hips, knees, and ankles should create a straight line when viewed from the front (Figure 5-6) throughout the absorption phase of jump landing. This form should also be emphasized when performing a countermovement (rapid, shallow squat) prior to a jump.

Physical Factors Many sports require athletes to perform explosive movements (e.g., jumps, sprints, cuts, etc.) throughout competition. These movements require both strength and power.

Directly related to strength and power, the development of speed (Figure 5-3) in athletes is also important when accelerating out of a turn, from a static start, and so forth (17). As such, immediately following a 4-week base lifting phase, two weeks of speed training with a focus on technique (e.g., arm action, posture, step length, stride frequency, etc.) and overall acceleration performance should be included in the training program prior to the addition of agility drills.

The basketball center will need additional time to reposition his/her longer legs between each step. Therefore, the soccer midfielder will likely have a faster performance time for the first 2 \u2013 3 strides out of a sharp turn. Other factors such as body mass, torso length, and joint flexibility will also have advantages and disadvantages in sports.

Beginning on Week 5, speed drills should be added twice per week on nonconsecutive explosive days (see the end of this chapter for sample speed programs). Agility drills can be added to the program on the strength days beginning on Week 7 (see the end of this chapter for sample agility programs). These two strength days should be opposite to the explosive days, making four running days per week. As with any training program, all exercises and skills should be progressive in nature. The first time athletes perform a new drill, they will not be familiar with the movement. A significant amount of attention by the athletes will be required to perform the drill. Once the athletes have become familiar with the drill (familiarity will vary depending on the difficulty of the drill) they will know some key aspects of the movement, but attention will still be needed when performing the drill. When practiced extensively, the athletes will develop better knowledge of the movement and will be able to perform the drill with less conscious attention to the specific movement patterns.

At this point, additional challenges (e.g., more complex movement patterns, catching a ball, etc.) may be incorporated into the drill to increase the difficulty. It is important to allow athletes to progress through all three phases of development before increasing the complexity of the drill for optimal performance gains. The following information pertains to standard techniques for basic agility training drills and some of their variations. Many strength training and conditioning programs regularly use these foundational drills. Everyone using these drills should have a sound understanding of how each of these drills and their variations are performed to optimize individual techniques. Performance technique for each drill listed below appears in the remainder of this chapter. Examples of agility training programs are provided at the end of this chapter. Figure 5-6.

One of the primary tasks of supervision is to ensure that safety practices are implemented by all concerned (7,8). In short, supervision is designed to prevent injuries due to inappropriate behaviors such as horseplay, daredevil-type stunts, and inattentiveness (31,32). There are two basic types of supervision, direct and indirect, based on proximity and involvement of the supervisor (23,27,28,38). Direct supervision involves closer contact and direction of the athlete(s) such as in teaching. Usually skill instruction and spotting involve direct supervision. Indirect supervision is common for observing activities in the weight room, but the supervisor is less close to the athletes. In situations when the skills of the activities are well learned, and the athletes are fully competent at performing on their own, then indirect supervision is all that is necessary to maintain vigilant protection of the athletes.

However, anyone charged with either type of supervision should station him/herself to see all of the activities under his/her jurisdiction. As such, the supervisor should be able to see and stop all activity whenever circumstances dictate (41). Supervision is required as long as athletes are in the facility and sometimes when they are moving from one area of a larger facility to the weight room and back (9). The strength training and conditioning coach should know that his/her responsibility extends to ensuring that athletes moving from one facility to another are supervised at all times. Be aware that in school settings you may need to collect students at their classroom and return them to their classroom.

Obviously, locker room and restroom facilities should be supervised carefully when an instructor or supervisor of the opposite gender must intervene. If possible, have supervisors of both genders present during strength training and conditioning activities. Stranded participants \u2013 Perhaps too often, young participants arrive at the facility via a parent or non-custodial parent (e.g., the parent who drove the carpool). However, if an athlete\u2019s ride home is late when training is completed, supervisors should never be alone with a single youngster in the facility; this is particularly true when the youngster is of the opposite gender.

However, pairing an athlete that is physically more mature with an athlete that is physically less mature can invite problems.

Sickle cell trait diagnosis should have been made at birth, and records of this disease, or simply notification of its presence, should be available to the strength training and conditioning coach. Complications from sickle cell trait occur in many competitive sports. Athletes with this condition will show moderate fatigue, but can still talk and move (1,2,4). If they are suffering from the condition, they will likely have ischemic (lack of oxygen making it to body tissues) pain and muscle weakness (1,2,4). Heat, altitude exposure, asthma, and dehydration may be contributors to the condition even when the exercise is mild.

Do not hesitate to seek medical help Sudden Cardiac Death Although sudden cardiac death is rare, the devastating consequences obviously merit focused attention. Sudden cardiac death is considered a non-traumatic and unexpected death due to cardiac causes within one hour of symptoms onset (30). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the main cause of sudden cardiac death accounting for 48% of recorded deaths in a sample of 134 athletes, although 17 different causes have been identified (30,36). Unfortunately, most athletes who suffer sudden cardiac death have no symptoms before death and no history of family or personal cardiac problems. Moreover, pre-participation screening using electrocardiography and echocardiography identify only a small percentage of athletes who may have serious cardiac conditions.

Concussion A concussion is a brain injury caused by a blow to the head that results in shaking, or otherwise traumatizing, the brain. The brain, housed inside the skull, is surrounded by and floats in cerebrospinal fluid. Concussions, although always a part of contact sports, appear to be trending upward based on epidemiological data (11). Concussions do not have to be present with unconsciousness, and most people will fully recover from a concussion. Some serious concussions and concussive events that happen repeatedly may require surgery. Concussions are serious and can be trauma of such significance that the injury affects the athlete for the rest of his/her life (16,42,44,47). Symptoms of a concussion include: \u2022 Unconsciousness \u2022 Unclear thinking \u2022 Inability to concentrate \u2022 Forgetfulness \u2022 Headache \u2022 Blurred vision \u2022 Nausea and vomiting \u2022 Dizziness \u2022 Light sensitivity \u2022 Ataxia (balance problems) \u2022 Agitation \u2022 Inability to sleep If an athlete suffers a concuss", "source": "basics_of_strength_and_conditioning_manual.pdf", "page": 99, "chunk": 1}, "29013916539902": {"text": "ncentrate \u2022 Forgetfulness \u2022 Headache \u2022 Blurred vision \u2022 Nausea and vomiting \u2022 Dizziness \u2022 Light sensitivity \u2022 Ataxia (balance problems) \u2022 Agitation \u2022 Inability to sleep If an athlete suffers a concussion, the athlete should be removed from play for the entire day. The seriousness of this type of head injury cannot be judged by a layperson. Appearance of any of the symptoms listed above should merit a medical examination. The athlete should be removed from all sport participation until cleared by a physician. Exertional Rhabdomyolysis Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the degeneration or destruction of muscle tissue because of excessive and unaccustomed exercise. Rhabdomyolysis has been seen in emergency medical settings due to circumstances such as suspension syndrome when someone is held aloft for period of minutes to hours while blood flow to and from the legs is cut off due to a harness or rope acting like a tourniquet. In strength training and conditioning settings, exertional rhabdomyolysis is caused by excessive exercise (21,34,40). The best treatment for rhabdomyolysis is prevention.

Recommendations for avoiding heat-related performance problems include: 1. Encourage and even enforce frequent rest periods in hot and humid environments 2. Encourage maintenance of hydration by frequent drink breaks (thirst is a poor indicator of dehydration\u2014encourage fluid intake before the athlete is thirsty) 3.

The incorporation of free weight movements can be performed as a person increases his or her muscular fitness. For example, advanced individuals can perform multiple sets and heavier resistances using multiple-joint exercises, such as squats and deadlifts. Whichever form of resistance is chosen, multiple-joint, large muscle group exercises should be performed before single-joint, smaller group exercises.

Frequency refers to the number of exercise sessions per week. How to manipulate each of these for the optimal enhancement of strength, power, hypertrophy, or muscular endurance is described below. MUSCULAR STRENGTH Muscular strength is the ability of a muscle or muscle group to exert a maximal external force. \u2022 Load: 60-70% 1RM for novice to intermediate; 80-100% for advanced \u2022 Volume: 1-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions for novice to intermediate; 2-6 sets of 1-8 repetitions for advanced \u2022 Rest period: 2-3 min for higher intense exercises that use heavier loads; 1-2 minutes between the lower intense exercises with light loads MUSCULAR POWER Power is defined as the optimal amount of work performed in a given time period.

STAYING ACTIVE PAYS OFF! Those who are physically active tend to live longer, healthier lives. Research shows that moderate physical activity \u2013 such as 30 minutes a day of brisk walking \u2013 significantly contributes to longevity. Even a person with risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes or even a smoking habit can gain real benefits from incorporating regular physical activity into their daily life.

The exercises and guidelines included here are intended for use by healthy adults. However, before beginning any exercise program, consult your physician. General population These guidelines may help you establish a successful strength training program: \u2022 Before beginning your strength training exercises, warm up your muscles. \u2022 Remember to breathe as you exercise. Do not hold your breath. Inhale through easy moves and exhale through hard moves. \u2022 Begin your program with 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise.

Older adults Your age should not keep you from a strength training program. If you are healthy, there are many reasons why a program of strength training exercises may benefit you. Check with your physician before beginning any exercise program. These guidelines may help you establish a successful strength training program: \u2022 Learn the proper techniques for each strength training exercise you do. \u2022 Use moderate to minimum resistance for the first few weeks of your program. \u2022 Increase repetitions instead of the amount of weight. Do a maximum of 20 repetitions. \u2022 Remember to breathe as you exercise. Do not hold your breath.

Strength training usually will help a woman become stronger and leaner but not overly muscular. Isn\u2019t pumping iron just for body builders? Anyone can benefit from strength training. Strength training may offer you many benefits and protect your joints during your normal daily activities. Will I gain weight? At first, you may gain a little weight because muscle weighs more than fat. However, muscle burns more calories than fat, so if you maintain the same diet, eventually you may lose some \u201cfat\u201d weight. Is strength training safe for older adults? Strength training offers many benefits to older adults. Older adults who do strength training have a lower risk of hip fracture and reduced bone and muscle loss. Will I need to buy a lot of equipment or go to a gym in order to have a successful strength training program? You can begin with 1-, 2- and 5-pound weights or even soup cans or milk bottles.

Some people find it easier to be more consistent with their exercise in a gym or health club environment; some prefer to exercise at home. A gym or health club may offer more opportunities to use equipment and machines that are not practical for home use. However, you can also do a good job at home using free weights and other forms of resistance, such as tubing. Are injuries a problem with strength training? If it is correctly done, strength training should not cause injuries. How much time do I need to spend exercising? You don\u2019t have to spend your whole afternoon exercising. Studies have shown that a 1-set program with a weight that causes fatigue of the muscle at the twelfth repetition can give you the same benefits in strength and muscle mass as a 3-set program. Just one set for the major muscle groups in the upper and lower body is enough to achieve significant gains in strength and muscle tone.
